We're pleased to announce our second annual [Buckets Community Survey!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmiVD4h3GJ7iycFplYGAujPg95aOcI-EOZx-SZ3wNFrasTTQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)  Whether you use Buckets or not, your feedback will help us understand Buckets' strengths and weaknesses, get to know who's using it and help determine where we go in the future.

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 2rem;"><a style="background-color: #2ecc71; padding: .75rem 1rem; color: white; border-radius: 2px;" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmiVD4h3GJ7iycFplYGAujPg95aOcI-EOZx-SZ3wNFrasTTQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Answer Survey</a></div>

It shouldn't take longer than 3-5 minutes.  Submissions will be accepted for a month or two depending on the response rate.  After the survey closes, we'll publish results here on this blog.

Thank you for your time!
