This is a short post, but I wanted to highlight one of my favorite, simple features in [Buckets](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com)&mdash;multiple windows.

Yes, I'm still working on the mobile apps :)  And yes, there's a [new Buckets Beta version out](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/download), which fixes a number of bugs.  Anyway...

Often, while we're doing our budget, we want to see both the transactions for the month as well as the bucket balances.  Click the *Budget* menu, then *Duplicate Window* (or the shortcut Control-N/Command-N) and voil√†!

Two windows, always in sync!

This is also helpful when doing Amazon reconciliation, or in comparing two different months.  Sometimes you just need to see two things at once.

What's your favorite feature in Buckets?
