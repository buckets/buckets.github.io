Here's a quick update about the mobile app. Yes, I'm *still* working on it.

We've had a busy few months finishing the kitchen in our house which has taken time from Buckets. Due to supply chain problems, we've done a lot more of the renovation ourselves than we had planned. For instance, I know that we have 2,600 shelf pin holes in our kitchen.

For iOS, all issues seem to be resolved except for this pesky problem:

To solve it, we'll be building both Android and iOS mobile apps in the "cloud." Once that work is done, expect to see an invite soon!
