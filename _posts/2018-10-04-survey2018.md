We're pleased to announce our first annual [Buckets Community Survey!](https://goo.gl/forms/pxfAKfkaURZwSO553)  Whether you use Buckets or not, your feedback will help us understand Buckets' strengths and weaknesses, get to know who's using it and help determine where we go in the future.

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 2rem;"><a style="background-color: #2ecc71; padding: .75rem 1rem; color: white; border-radius: 2px;" href="https://goo.gl/forms/pxfAKfkaURZwSO553">Answer Survey</a></div>

It shouldn't take longer than 3-5 minutes.  And it might even be fun :wink:.  Submissions will be accepted for a few months depending on the response rate.

Also, we would appreciate any help sharing this survey.  After the survey closes, we'll publish results here on this blog.

Thank you for your time!

P.S. Yes, I'm still working on the mobile app :grin:
