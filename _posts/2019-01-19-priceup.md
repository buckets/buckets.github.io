We've analyzed [last year's community survey](/2018/12/04/survey2018results.html) and Buckets' worth and costs.  As a result, in the beginning of March 2019 Buckets will cost $49.

Everything else about the license will be the same, including the untimed trial.  If you've already purchased (or purchase before the price increase) you don't have to pay anything to continue using Buckets.

We were hoping this price change would coincide with the release of the mobile apps, but they *still* aren't ready yet.  We're still working on them.

Happy budgeting and thank you for all your support!
