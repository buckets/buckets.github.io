Hi everyone!  I'm just highlighting some of the work we've been doing lately on [Buckets](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com): Lots of bug fixes, a little more mobile work and some business development.

## Bugs, bugs, bugs

I took a big swing at fixing bugs in May.  Over 14 were fixed in the [two Beta releases](https://github.com/buckets/application/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0553---2019-05-27) and there's another 7 or so that will be fixed in the [next release](https://github.com/buckets/application/labels/included%20in%20next%20release).  There will be less than [20 outstanding bugs](https://github.com/buckets/application/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+sort%3Acreated-asc+-label%3A%22included+in+next+release%22) once those get released!  Some of my favorite fixes:

- Better Cyrillic support.  (As a reminder, if you want Buckets in your own language, [it's fairly straightforward.](https://github.com/buckets/translations#current-language-support))
- Entering transfers now works again
- Lots of visual tweaks

Even though I'm excited about the mobile app, I didn't want to let the desktop app suffer.  I'm hoping to get a bunch of the remaining CSV/OFX/QFX importing bugs fixed in the release after this.

## Mobile

Mobile development is still going slowly.  It'll likely first be released with very limited functionality to those brave enough to wade through bugs.

## Business Longevity Development

We've been spending a good chunk of time working to make sure Buckets endures.  Look for more announcements about this in the coming months!  No, we're not moving to a subscription!  Don't worry :) You're going to like the change; I promise.

Happy Budgeting!
