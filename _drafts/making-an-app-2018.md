[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) has been a game-changer for desktop app development.  It raises the bar for getting started quickly, having automatic updates and reusing existing code (JavaScript, in this case).  But it lowers the bar (significantly) in application file size, memory consumption and speed.  So I'm always on the look out for a better alternative to Electron.

In the process of building the Buckets mobile apps, I've considered which options for mobile apps could also translate to a better desktop app experience.  I keep [a long list of alternatives](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTZIp6z2J1IL7YgBlHG_x68x0_zfecU0MTsjTXn1E3A/edit?usp=sharing), but I'll highlight some of my favorites here:


## JUCE

## Flutter

## Qt

## Haxe

## ReactNative
