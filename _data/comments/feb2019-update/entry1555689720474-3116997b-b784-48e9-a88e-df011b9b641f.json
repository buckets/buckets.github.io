  "comment": "Looking forward to both the mobile app and the bug squashing.  Using Buckets for less than a month, I've noticed a couple things with transfers that might be considered bugs, or might not depending on the vision for the program:\n\n1.  When I enter a transfer, it creates two transactions that are not linked.  If I see that I had a typo in the amount, I need to edit both transactions to fix it.\n\n2.  If I'm in the April register and enter a transfer for May 1 (scheduled payment of my credit card, in this case), the transaction is created on May 1 in the account where I enter it; but it shows up on the current date in the other account.  This can be prevented by entering the transfer in the May register; but having separate registers by month is new to me so I didn't predict this.",
