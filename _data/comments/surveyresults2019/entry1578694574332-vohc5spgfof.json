  "comment": "Congratulations on another great year Matt. You deserve all the accolades we can throw at you. I unfortunately missed the survey but I'm very encouraged to see the results. I did wonder, is there a way you can see how wide the user base appears to be compared to last year i.e. website downloads or hits etc? Also, wanted to let you know I did recommend buckets in r/personalfinance. I hope it made some dent https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/eir6xw/a_case_for_buckets_budget_software/",
