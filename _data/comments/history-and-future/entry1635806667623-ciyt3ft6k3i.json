  "comment": "Hey David,\n\nThe trial version is limited in the following ways:\n\n1. There's a yellow \"Trial Version\" sticker in the bottom corner of the Buckets window.\n2. After a while, it will prompt you to purchase on startup (but if you need more time to try it out, you can dismiss it)\n3. Every budget includes a bucket to help you save for a license.\n\nOther than that, it's the same.  Take it for a spin!",
