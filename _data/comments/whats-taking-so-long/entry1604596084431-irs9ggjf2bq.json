Also it's great that you're using Nim, it will surely provide an extra fun factor in the development process.\n\nIf possible, please try to give a little touch here and there to the Desktop version in the meantime, that's what 100% of users are now using while waiting for the mobile app, so some small but delightful QoL / UI updates (I've sent some suggestions before) once or twice a year would be appreciated by fans and ease the wait :)",
