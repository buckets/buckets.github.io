  "comment": "Another potential YNAB migrant here! :) Getting the notice this morning that my price will go up 2x from a company that I have supported for more than 10 years is just not something I am interested in at the most basic, philosophical level. I need to check out Buckets since it looks to be a basic tool that gets the job done which is what I use YNAB for anyway. I don't need all the splashy videos and such... just a basic budgeting solution that will track my accounts and \"bucket\" balances over time. If your Buckets app ever turns into a company, make sure you don't alienate your most loyal customers and fan base by raising their price 2x out of the blue one day!",
