  "comment": "Hi Oivind,\n\nI haven't found a way to track all columns using only SQL.  This is because I can't figure out a way to do the equivalent  of something like OLD[somecolumn] to choose the field from OLD whose key is the value of somecolumn.  SQLite doesn't seem to provide that level of reflection.\n\nInstead (as noted in the last section) I punt to the language I'm using SQLite from to construct the triggers.  Hope that helps!",
